# pkgrename
Renames PS4 PKG files based on param.sfo information and predefined patterns.
Requires Bash script "sfo" (https://github.com/hippie68/sfo) in your $PATH environment variable.

Usage: `pkgrename [-hs] [file/folder ...]`  
Option -s searches the PS Store for hopefully better file names but is super slow. Could be useful for DLC especially.

Further info on how to customize your file names is found inside the pkgrename script.
